# ldrgen

This is ldrgen, a small experimental random C program generator.


## Introduction

This program is a generator of C code: On every call it generates a new
random C function and prints it to the standard output. The generator is
"liveness-driven", which means that it tries to avoid generating dead code:
All the computations it generates are (in a certain, limited sense) actually
used to compute the function's return value. Other than this, ldrgen does
not do much to ensure that its output resembles anything like "real"
programs.

See [Csmith](https://github.com/csmith-project/csmith) for another C program
generator that is in many ways more sophisticated than this.

A paper describing ldrgen has been accepted for presentation at the LOPSTR
2017 conference. A preprint is at
[lopstr2017_ldrgen_preprint.pdf](lopstr2017_ldrgen_preprint.pdf).

## TODOs

Many more C language constructs should be added.


## Installation

This program is implemented as a plugin for Frama-C <http://frama-c.com/>.
It should run on all Unix-like platforms with Frama-C and standard build
tools.

Your favorite package manager may provide a Frama-C package that installs
all you need. Otherwise, the easiest way to install Frama-C is to first
install OPAM, the OCaml package manager <http://opam.ocaml.org/>. You can
then run:

    opam install frama-c

See <https://www.frama-c.com/html/get-frama-c.html> for more information on
installing Frama-C via OPAM. ldrgen is known to work with Frama-C 26.1
(Iron) on OCaml 4.11.1 installed via OPAM 2.0.7.

With Frama-C installed and the `frama-c` executable in your path, you can
compile ldrgen by running `dune build` and install it with `dune install`.
It will be installed in Frama-C's plugin directory. You can remove it again
by running `dune uninstall`.

For now, run ldrgen as `frama-c -ldrgen`. See `frama-c -ldrgen-h` for
documentation on some command-line flags that can affect the generated code.
