# ldrgen

This is ldrgen, a small experimental random C program generator.


## Introduction

This program is a generator of C code: On every call it generates a new
random C function and prints it to the standard output. The generator is
"liveness-driven", which means that it tries to avoid generating dead code:
All the computations it generates are (in a certain, limited sense) actually
used to compute the function's return value. Other than this, ldrgen does
not do much to ensure that its output resembles anything like "real"
programs.

See [Csmith](https://github.com/csmith-project/csmith) for another C program
generator that is in many ways more sophisticated than this.

## TODOs

Many more C language constructs should be added.


## Installation

This program is implemented as a plugin for Frama-C <http://frama-c.com/>.
It should run on all Unix-like platforms with Frama-C and standard build
tools.

Your favorite package manager may provide a Frama-C package that installs
all you need. Otherwise, the easiest way to install Frama-C is to first
install OPAM, the OCaml package manager <http://opam.ocaml.org/>. You can
then run

    opam install frama-c

or

    opam install frama-c-base

The latter should ask you for fewer additional system libraries to install,
but I have not tested ldrgen with it.

With Frama-C installed and the `frama-c` executable in your path, you can
compile ldrgen by running `make` and install it with `make install`. It will
be installed in Frama-C's plugin directory. You can remove it again by
running `make uninstall`.

For now, run ldrgen as `frama-c -ldrgen`. See `frama-c -ldrgen-h` for
documentation on some command-line flags that can affect the generated code.
